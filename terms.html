    <p class="pt-5">14.6 We may make all other amendments to the Agreement by posting the revised Agreement on the Site or by
        emailing it to you, indicating when the revised Agreement becomes effective. Although we will endeavor
        to provide you with advance notice where possible, where lawful we may indicate that the revised
        Agreement shall be effective immediately and if you do not agree with any such modification, you should
        close your Invity Account and cease using the Invity Services.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.7 Copies of the most up-to-date version of the Agreement will be made available in the Site at all
        times and will be provided to you by email on your request.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.8 Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, either
        you or Invity to be treated as partners or joint ventures, or either you or Invity to be treated as
        the agent of the other.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.9 If you receive information about another user through the Invity Services, you must keep the
        information confidential and only use it in connection with the Invity Services. You may not disclose
        or distribute a user’s information to a third party or use the information except as reasonably
        necessary to carry out a transaction and other functions reasonably incidental thereto such as support,
        reconciliation and accounting unless you receive the user’s express consent to do so. You may not send
        unsolicited communications to another user through Invity.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.10 Contact Information. You are responsible for keeping your email address and telephone number up to
        date in your Invity Account profile in order to receive any notices or alerts that we may send you
        (including notices or alerts of actual or suspected Security Breaches).</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including documents incorporated by reference herein) comprise
        the entire understanding and agreement between you and Invity as to the subject matter hereof, and it
        supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without
        limitation any prior versions of this Agreement), and every nature between and among you and
        Invity.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.12 Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not govern the meaning or
        interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.13 This Agreement is personal to you and you cannot transfer or assign your rights, licenses,
        interests and/or obligations to anyone else. We may transfer or assign our rights licenses, interests
        and / or our obligations at any time, including as part of a merger, acquisition or other corporate
        reorganization involving Invity, provided that this transfer or assignment does not materially impact
        the quality of the Invity Services you receive. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and
        inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.14 Invalidity. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under
        any applicable law, this will not affect the validity of any other provision. If any provision is found
        unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will be
        enforced.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.15 We may not always strictly enforce our rights under this Agreement. If we do choose not to enforce
        our rights at any time, this is a temporary measure and we may enforce our rights strictly again at any
        time.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.16 This Agreement and any information or notifications that you or we are to provide should be in
        English. Any translation of this Agreement or other documents is provided for your convenience only and
        may not accurately represent the information in the original English. In the event of any inconsistency,
        the English language version of this Agreement or other documents shall prevail.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.17 Change of Control. In the event that Invity is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we
        reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have
        collected from you and our relationship with you (including this Agreement) as part of such merger,
        acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.18 All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination
        of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Sections relating to suspension or termination,
        Invity Account cancellation, debts owed to Invity, general use of the Site, disputes with Invity, and
        general provisions will continue to be binding and operate after the termination or expiration of this
        Agreement.</p>
    <p class="pt-5">14.19 If you have any feedback, questions, or complaints, you may contact us via our customer support
        webpage.</p>

    <p class="pt-5">15. According to generally acceptable AML rules and regulations, withdrawals must be performed only through the same bank account or Credit / Debit card that the customer used to deposit the funds. Unless we agree otherwise, withdrawals from the Account may only be made in the same FIAT currency in which the respective deposit was made. In addition, when you deposit or withdraw money for trading purposes using alternative FIAT payment methods, you should be aware that additional fees and restrictions may apply. Withdrawals are subjected to withdrawals processing and handling fees. Please note, according to the AML policy, for the accounts that were created for the Funds Recovery program those fees cannot be deducted from the transferred withdrawn amount.
        Without derogating of the foregoing, we may execute withdrawals to a different facility than the one used for the deposit, in accordance with Anti Money Laundering regulations.</p>
