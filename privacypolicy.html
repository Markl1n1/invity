    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Information we collect automatically or generate about you</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">This includes information we collect automatically, such as whenever you interact with the Sites or use the Services. This information helps us address customer support issues, improve the performance of our Sites and applications, provide you with a streamlined and personalized experience, and protect your account from fraud by detecting unauthorized access. Information collected automatically includes:</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Information collected from third parties</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">This includes information we may obtain about you from third party sources. The main types of third parties we receive your personal information from are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Databases, Credit Bureaus &amp; ID Verification Partners </strong> in order to verify your identity in accordance with applicable law. ID verification partners such as Experian use a combination of government records and publicly available information about you to verify your identity. Such information may include your name, address, job role, public employment profile, credit history, status on any sanction’s lists maintained by public authorities, and other relevant data.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain Data </strong> to ensure parties using our Services are not engaged in illegal or prohibited activity and to analyze transaction trends for research and development purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing Partners &amp; Resellers</strong> so that we can better understand which of our Services may be of interest to you.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Anonymized and aggregated data</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        In addition to the categories of personal information described above, Invity will also process anonymized information and data that is not processed by reference to a specific individual. Types of data we may anonymize include transaction data, click-stream data, performance metrics and fraud indicators.
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">How we use your personal information</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We may use your information in the following ways and for the following purposes:</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5"><strong>1)To maintain legal and regulatory compliance</strong></p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">Invity needs to process your personal information in order to comply with anti-money laundering and security laws. In addition, when you seek to link a bank account to your Invity account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk as required under applicable law. We also process your personal information in order to help detect, prevent, and mitigate fraud and abuse of our Services and to protect you against account compromise or funds loss. If you do not provide personal information required by law, we will have to close your account.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5"><strong>2) To provide Invity's Services</strong></p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We process your personal information to provide Services to you. For example, when you want to store funds on our platform, we require certain information such as your identification, contact and payment information. Third parties that we use such as identity verification services may also access and/or collect your personal information when providing identity verification and/or fraud prevention services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with our Services. The consequences of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of your account.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5"><strong>3) To provide communications and customer services</strong></p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">According to your preferences and in compliance with applicable law, we may send you marketing communications
            to inform you about events, to deliver targeted marketing and to share promotional offers. If you are a new
            customer, we will contact you by electronic means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such
            communication. If you do not want us to send you marketing communications, please go to your account
            settings to opt-out.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We may send you service updates regarding administrative or account-related information, security issues, or
            other transaction-related information. These communications are important to share developments relating to
            your account that may affect how you can use our Services. You cannot opt-out of receiving critical service
            communications.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We also process your personal information when you contact us to resolve any questions, disputes, collect
            fees, or to troubleshoot problems. Without processing your personal information for such purposes, we cannot
            respond to your requests and ensure your uninterrupted use of the Services.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5"><strong>4) In our legitimate business interests</strong></p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">Sometimes the processing of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>quality control and staff training;</li>
            <li>to enhance security, monitor and verify identity or service access, and to combat spam or other malware or security risks;</li>
            <li>research and development purposes;</li>
            <li>to enhance your experience of our Services and Sites; or</li>
            <li>to facilitate corporate acquisitions, mergers, or transactions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Legal bases for processing your information</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        For individuals located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland at the time their personal data is collected, we rely on legal bases for processing your information under the relevant data protection legislation. These bases mean we will only process your data where we are legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), for our legitimate interests to operate our business, to protect Invity's or your property rights, or where we have obtained your consent to do so. We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission.
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Disclosing your personal information to third parties</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We allow your personal information to be accessed only by those who require access to perform their work and share it only with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. Invity will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. We will only share your personal information with the following types of third parties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity verification services to prevent fraud. This allows Invity to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases.</li>
            <li>Financial institutions which we partner with to process payments you have authorized.</li>
            <li>Service providers and professional advisors under contract who help with parts of our business operations. Our contracts require these service providers to only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and prohibit them from sharing your information with anyone else.</li>
            <li>Companies or other third parties in connection with business transfers or bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
            <li>Companies or other entities that purchase Invity assets.</li>
            <li>Law enforcement, regulators, or any other third parties when we are compelled to do so by applicable law or if we have a good faith belief that such use is reasonably necessary, including to: protect the rights, property, or safety of Invity, Invity customers, third party, or the public; comply with legal obligations or requests; enforce our terms and other agreements; or detect or otherwise address security, fraud, or technical issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Third-party sites and services</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">If you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your Invity Services, then information
            you have provided to Invity may be shared with those third parties. A connection you authorize or
            enable between your Invity account and a non-Invity account, payment instrument, or platform is
            considered an “account connection.” Unless you provide further permissions, Invity will not authorize
            these third parties to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions
            using Invity Services. Please note that third parties you interact with, should have their own privacy
            policies and Invity is not responsible for their operations or their use of data they collect.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">Examples of account connections include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merchants:</strong> If you use your Invity account to conduct a transaction with a third party merchant, the merchant may provide data about you and your transaction to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Your financial services providers:</strong> For example, if you send us funds from your bank account, your bank will provide us with identifying information in addition to information about your account in order to complete the transaction.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">How we protect and store personal information</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">Invity implements and maintains reasonable measures to protect our information and information systems. Customer files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity of the relevant information. Reasonable controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems. Physical access to areas where personal information is gathered, processed or stored is limited to authorized employees.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers anywhere in the world where our facilities or service providers are located. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">As a condition of employment, Invity’s employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including in relation to data protection law. Access to sensitive personal information is limited to those employees who need to it to perform their roles. Unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential customer information by a Invity employee is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">When you contact a Invity employee about your file, you may be asked for some personal details. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorized by you, has access to your file. You also play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, don’t reveal it to any third-parties and immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Retention of personal information</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">How long we hold your personal information for will vary. The retention period will be determined by the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the purpose for which we are using your personal information – we will need to keep the information for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and</li>
            <li>legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">If you have further questions about our data retention practices, please contact us.</p>
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5">If we anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, it will no
            longer be considered personal information, and we can use it without further notice to you.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Children's personal information</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, Invity will require the user to close his or her account and will not allow the user to continue using our Services. We will also take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our Services.
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Cross border transfers</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        Invity is an international business. This means we may transfer to locations outside of your country. When we transfer your personal information to another country, we will ensure that any transfer of your personal information is compliant with applicable data protection law.
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Your privacy rights</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="padding-p-two pt-5"><strong>Depending on applicable law of where you reside</strong>, you may be able to assert certain rights related to your personal information. These rights include:</p>

            <li>the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time. Please note, however, that we may still be entitled to process your personal information if we have another legitimate reason for doing so. For example, we may need to retain personal information to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
            <li>in some circumstances, the right to receive some personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or request that we transmit those data to a third party where this is technically feasible.

            <li>the right to request that we rectify your personal information if it is inaccurate or incomplete;</li>
            <li>the right to request that we erase your personal information in certain circumstances. Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your personal information, but we are legally entitled to retain it;</li>
            <li>the right to object to, or request that we restrict, our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. Again, there may be circumstances where you object to, or ask us to restrict, our processing of your personal information but we are legally entitled to refuse that request; and</li>
            <li>the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator if you think that any of your rights have been infringed by us.</li>
