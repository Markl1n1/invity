    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">What are cookies?</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="pt-5">Our website, like many others, uses cookies in order to work properly.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">Cookies are small text files that are downloaded onto your device when you access our website. They allow
            us to recognize your device and store some information about your preferences or past actions on our
            website, ultimately allowing us to improve your experience. This cookie policy describes the kinds of
            information that we gather, how we use the information, and why we need to store these cookies. We will
            also explain how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or break
            certain elements of the site's functionality.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">For more general information on cookies, see this <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia article</a></p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">How we use cookies</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        We use cookies to understand how users interact with our services and thus how we can improve them. Details of this usage are described below. Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to the site. It is recommended that you accept our usage of cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not, in case they are necessary for a service that you use.
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">The types of cookies we use</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="pt-5">If you create an account at our site, then we will use cookies for the management of the sign-up process and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out; however, in some cases they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">We use cookies when you are logged in, so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">When you submit data through a form such as a contact page or comment box, cookies may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">In order to provide you with a great experience on this site, we provide the functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember your preferences, we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page that is affected by your preferences.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">Some of the cookies we use are persistent, which means that they remain stored on your device for one year.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">As we sell services, it is important for us to understand statistics on how many of the visitors to our site actually make a purchase, and thus cookies will track this kind of data. This is important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to monitor our advertising and product costs to ensure the best possible price.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">The behavioral advertising cookies used by this site are designed to ensure that we provide you with the most relevant adverts where possible by anonymously tracking your interests and presenting similar things that you may like.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">In some cases, we may provide you with custom content based on what you tell us about yourself, either directly or indirectly if you link a social media account. These types of cookies simply allow us to provide you with content that we feel may be of interest to you.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="font-medium text-lg text-center pt-[75px]">Use of third-party cookies</h2>
    <div class="pt-5">
        <p class="pt-5">In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section specifies which third-party cookies you might encounter at this site and reasons why we use them.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">Third-party analytics are used to track and measure usage of this site so that we can continue to produce engaging content. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site or pages you visit, which helps us to understand how we can improve the site for you.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the way the site is delivered. While we are still testing new features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience on our site. That way, we will be able to understand which optimizations our users appreciate most.</p>
        <p class="pt-5">Several partners advertise on our behalf and affiliate-tracking cookies simply allow us to see if our customers have come to the site through one of our partner sites. This lets us credit them appropriately, and also allows you to enjoy any bonuses they might be offering for use of their service.</p>
